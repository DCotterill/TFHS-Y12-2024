## Projects I've worked on

Somfy Remote:
https://github.com/DCotterill/Somfy_Remote

An update of the Arduino based mircocontroller code to control Somfy electronic blinds. Let's me connect all my house blinds to Google Home to open and close them with voice commands

Strava Stats:
https://github.com/DCotterill/StravaStats

Some scripts to use the Strava.com API to get my running stats data and make charts. I wanted to try and run 42k of climbing elevation in 1 year, so wanted a chart to track it.

Soccer Tracking:
https://github.com/DCotterill/SoccerTracking

Just starting this one... it's using a Machine Learning model ( and a library called Yolo) to recognise a moving soccer ball in real time video. The goal is to make a skills based game, kinda Dance Dance Revolution but for soccer skills.
